##Getting Started
---

###If you have `node.js` and `git`:
Open your preffered CLI and navigate to the working directory where you want to download the source code. Then run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/jstruthers/apropos_netkurs

npm install

gulp
```

This should install all the necessary files and dependencies, start a local web server, and open a new browser window or tab to display the web app.

###Otherwise:
This project requires two command line utilities to get up and running.

If you don't have the `git` command line interface (CLI), you can download it for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

The second program required is Node Package Manager, or npm. If you don't have `node.js` installed on your machine, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Verify that these programs have been properly installed by typing the following into your preffered CLI:

(eg. Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows)

```
node -v; npm -v; git --version
```
